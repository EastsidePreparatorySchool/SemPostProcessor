First order of business:

Seniors will not be present the 15th-19th, which means Gavin Uberti and Jackson Fellows will be the only ones in class of our group. 

Gavin will be gone 5/2

I have decided we will abandon KanbanFlow for now. People aren't updating to it, which is fine; it just means we should figure out another 
way to keep track of stuff live that is easy for everyone.

What was done this sprint:

Calendar of the next month
Metadata work
/upload support
Crop and rotate functionality
UI:
  fullscreen
  toolbar
  sliders for brightness and contrast
  implementation (not for everything yet of course)

Gavin, I took a look at your HTML code, I believe there's a JS link in there without a source in GitHub. If that could get uploaded that 
would be great. Awesome job otherwise.

Caden, excellent job with UI, especially contrast and brightness menus with sliders; fantastic start. However, I don't like the graying effect.
Jackson, do you think it's possible so that when a menu comes out, like contrast or brightness, the image container shrinks? Right now 
it seems like the menu will overlap a photo, which I don't think we want. If you can change that, it would greatly improve the feel. But, 
if you have something more important to work on, don't let this distract you, we may be able to work around it.

Still waiting to hear back from algorithms. We will talk in class tomorrow.
